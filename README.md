# pnr status
This is a simple console application which tells you about your [pnr status](http://www.indianrail.gov.in/pnr_Enq.html).

This app is different because it keeps making requests to the Indian Railway Servers so that it has the most up to date information. You don't manually have to check the status your self using this app.

##Installation

```bash
npm install -g pnr-status
```

##Usage

Simple pass the PNR number as a parameter to the ```pnr-status``` command.

```bash
pnr-status 8216477093
```
